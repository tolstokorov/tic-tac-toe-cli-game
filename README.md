# Tic Tac Toe CLI Game 

## *written in the C programming language*
## *written in the beginning of summer 2018*

This is my first program. It's really awful. Seriously. But I wrote it after 2 month of studying by *K&R book*. Now I don't use the C language in my work.

Honestly, about 2.5 years ago, after completing this small project, I interrupted my own programming lessons. It happened because I couldn't imagine next step: how to write really big program in the C language as a big smart guys.

And I interrupted education. And after all of that I was doing nothing as a programer until next spring. But I don't worry about that because this loss help me choose the right way. However it's the other story. *(Pss. I choosed Frontend!)*

As a result the knowledge of the C language helped me understand JavaScript and TypeScript faster and deeper.

The End :)
